# Trellis — Claude Code Instructions

## What is Trellis?

Multi-workspace LLM desktop app (Electron + React 19 + Express + SQLite) that multiplexes AI coding sessions across workspaces with built-in code review. See ARCHITECTURE.md for data flow, PLAN.md for active implementation work (with PLAN-DONE.md as the shipped-spec archive), and UX_POLISH.md for visual and interaction papercuts (lower-bar observations logged during dogfooding).

## Hard Rules

### IPC Boundary
- Renderer NEVER imports from `src/` (backend). All Node/OS access goes through the Express API or WebSocket.
- SQLite writes happen in the backend process only.

### CSS
- No inline styles — use CSS Modules (`.module.css`) exclusively in React components.
- No hardcoded colors — all colors reference CSS custom properties from `tokens.css`.
- Use CSS logical properties (`margin-inline-start`, `padding-block-end`, `inset-block-start`) — never physical equivalents. Stylelint enforces this; run `pnpm run lint:css` before commit.

### Syntax highlighting
- Use `shiki` (lazy-loaded singleton) for diff rows and chat code blocks.
- Helpers live in `dashboard/src/utils/highlighter.ts`.
- The diff renderer is a custom row-based component over a parsed unified diff (`dashboard/src/utils/diffParser.ts`) — no Monaco.

### API Keys
- Store/retrieve via `electron.safeStorage` IPC only.
- NEVER in localStorage, electron-store, .env files, or the SQLite database.
- The `providers` table stores provider config but NOT keys.

### WebSocket Envelope
- EVERY WebSocket message MUST include `threadId`. This is critical for routing concurrent streams to the correct ChatPanel.
```typescript
interface WSMessage {
  threadId: string;
  type: string;
  data: unknown;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

## Commit Format

```
feat(P1.2): design tokens and app shell
fix(P2.3): missing path cross-check on launch
refactor(P3.1): extract git operations module
```

Phase prefix maps to the plan: P1 = Foundation+Chat+Sidebar, P2 = Review Panel, P3 = Git+Terminal, P4 = Polish.

## Verification

After every change:
```bash
pnpm typecheck          # TypeScript compilation (backend + dashboard)
pnpm test               # Vitest test suite
```

## Native Module Rebuild

`pnpm install` auto-rebuilds `better-sqlite3` and `node-pty` for system Node (via `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` in package.json). If you hit a `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch at runtime, repair with:

```bash
pnpm run rebuild:native
```

The project pins Node via `.nvmrc`. Run `pnpm install` / `pnpm run rebuild:native` from a shell where `node --version` matches that pin — otherwise the compiled ABI won't match the one Electron's backend subprocess launches with, and you'll see `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` errors at runtime.

### node-pty prebuild quirk

`pnpm rebuild node-pty` runs `node scripts/prebuild.js || node-gyp rebuild` from node-pty's postinstall. The prebuild script exits 0 when *any* prebuild exists for the platform, even if the ABI doesn't match the current Node — so the `||` fallback to `node-gyp rebuild` never fires, and `build/Release/pty.node` stays missing. If the app boots with `Failed to load native module: pty.node, checked: build/Release, build/Debug, prebuilds/darwin-arm64`, force a source compile:

```bash
cd node_modules/.pnpm/node-pty@*/node_modules/node-pty && npx node-gyp rebuild
```

That drops the binary at the path the loader expects. `better-sqlite3` doesn't have this quirk — plain `pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3` always compiles from source.

Trellis's backend runs as a `tsx` subprocess under system Node — not inside Electron's main process — so native modules must target system Node's ABI, which `pnpm rebuild` does by default. Do NOT use `@electron/rebuild` here; it would target Electron's ABI and break the backend subprocess.

## Key Patterns

### LLM Adapters
All adapters implement the same `LLMAdapter` interface (src/llm/types.ts). They call provider APIs directly — no CLI wrapping. The `stream()` method returns `AsyncIterable<StreamEvent>` with normalized event types.

### Tool Sandboxing
Every tool validates paths against the thread's workspace directory. Paths outside the workspace are rejected. The `bash` tool runs with `cwd` set to the workspace path.

### Session Runner
The tool loop in `src/session/runner.ts`: stream from LLM → if tool_use, execute tool → append result → loop. Multiple threads run concurrently via `Map<threadId, AbortController>`.

### Annotations → LLM Context
`formatFeedback()` converts annotations into natural language prepended to the next user message. After injection, annotations are marked `resolved = 1`.

## Transfer to Another Machine

```bash
pnpm run bundle  # creates ~/Desktop/trellis.bundle
# Transfer the .bundle file, then on target:
git clone trellis.bundle trellis
cd trellis && pnpm install
```
